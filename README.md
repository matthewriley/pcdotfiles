# Matt’s PC msys/cygwin dotfiles

This is a copy of my PC msys/cygwin dotfiles which are used in Windows with [Git Bash](http://msysgit.github.com/) ($OSTYPE = msys) and [Cygwin Terminal](http://www.cygwin.com/) ($OSTYPE = cygwin).

These files started as a copy of my [OS X dotfiles](https://github.com/matthewriley/dotfiles), which started as a copy of [Mathias Bynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). The primary difference is that most of the OS X settings and commands won't work. I've left them in there to make syncing with my OS X files a little easier.
